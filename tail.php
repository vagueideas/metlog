		Not my work:

		This php file is used to grab weathercloud data. The weather station will contact a URL and this
		event will be sent to an apache log file. This file will grab the last line (ie most recent) from
		the log file and then this can be parsed to get the variables.

		There is a good discussion on stack exchange about grabbing the last line or lines (ie tail) from 
		a file using php, and this is where this script came from:
		
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15025875/what-is-the-best-way-to-read-last-lines-i-e-tail-from-a-file-using-php


		The main program (updateweatherstation.php) calls this function
